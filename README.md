# Step 1: Discover: Pretty simple step, we went to the census site and downloaded the data we need

# Step 2:Collection: Downloaded the census data from the site, selecting ONLY the fields we wanted to use

# Step 4: Data Prep: We sanitized the csv file to be just the data we needed

# Step 5: Exploration: This is where Caleb went down a rabbit hole of fuckery

# Step 6: Modeling: Plugged data into already prepared files

# Step 7: Automation: Ran the files and they did the things!
